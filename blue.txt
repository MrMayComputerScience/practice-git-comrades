Somebody's heine is crowdin my ice box
Somebody's cold one is giving me chills


Flip on the telly
Wrestle with jimmy
Something is bubblin
behind my back
I guess I'll just close my eyes

oh yea
all right
feels good
inside

say it aint so
my love is a heart breaker
say it aint so
my love is a life taker

this bottle of stevens
awakens ancient feelings
like father 
step father
the son is drowning in the flood
