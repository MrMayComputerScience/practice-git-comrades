[Say it Ain't so]
Somebody's heine is crowdin my ice box
Somebody's cold one is giving me chills
guess ill just close my eyes

Flip on the telly
Wrestle with jimmy
Something is bubblin
behind my back
the bottle is ready to blow

oh yea
all right
feels good
inside

say it aint so
your drug is a heart breaker
say it aint so
my love is a life taker

I can't confront you
I never would do
that whichmight hurt you
so try and be cool
this way is a waterfal away from me
that takes you further every day
so be cool

say it aint so
your drug is a heart breaker
say it aint so
my love is a life taker

i write you in spite of years of silence
you've cleaned up, found jesus, things are good or so I hear
this bottle of stevens
awakens ancient feelings
like father 
step father
the son is drowning in the flood
