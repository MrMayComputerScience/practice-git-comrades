I keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust them off put em back up on the shelf
Incase my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooo woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I've been feelin it since 1966 now
Might be over now but I feel it still

Ooo woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like its 1986 now
Might be over now but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with the baby sitter momma call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooo woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I've been feelin it since 1966 now
might be over now but you feel it still

Ooo woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like its 1986 now
Might've had your fill but you feel it still

We can fight a war for peace
Give in to that easy livin
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flippin for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come in
Its time to give a little to the kids in the middle
but oh until it falls dont bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

Ooo woo im a rebel just for kicks now
your love is an abyss for me heart to eclipse now
Might be over now but I feel it still

Ooo woo im a rebel just for kicks now
I've been feelin it since 1966 now
Might be over now but I feel it stil

Ooo woo im a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like its 1986 now
Might of had your fill but you feel it still
Might be over now but you feel it still
